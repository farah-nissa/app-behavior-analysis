# E-Commerce App User Behavior Analysis

Hi! This is my streamlit project.

Using an e-commerce app user activity dataset, I built a dashboard highlighting users in-app activity, products they buy, revenue they generate.
In this site, you can also find a promotion eligibility model that can be useful for deciding whether a user is eligible to get a promotional offer for a product.

You can explore the site through this link - https://app-behavior-analysis.streamlit.app/

Please feel free to reach out for any inquiries or discussion.
Thanks!
